📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge for businesses such as telecom companies, SaaS platforms, and banks.
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to leave a service (churn) using machine learning.

A Logistic Regression model is trained on historical customer data to classify customers as:

1 → Churn

0 → Not Churn

🎯 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to build a binary classification model that predicts customer churn based on customer demographics, service usage, and billing information.

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Telco Customer Churn Dataset

Records: 7,000+ customers

Target Variable: Churn (Yes / No)

🧠 Machine Learning Model
Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is used to predict the probability of customer churn.
It is suitable for this problem because:

It performs well on binary classification tasks

It is easy to interpret

It is widely used in real-world business applications

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

The model performance is evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

ROC-AUC Score

These metrics help measure how well the model predicts customer churn.

🚀 Results

The Logistic Regression model successfully identifies customers who are likely to churn and provides a solid baseline for churn prediction in real-world business scenarios.
